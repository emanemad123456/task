How Web Works ???

1.The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on .
2.The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client . 
3.This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
4.If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", 
and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, 
and you bring them back to your house).
The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you .



What the client server model ???

The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers,
and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the
server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. 
Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.
